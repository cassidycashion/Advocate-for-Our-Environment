        Why & How I Became an Environmentalist
      </h2>
 
       <p id="instructions">
  In short, I realized the dire condition of our beaches, water, and planet in general. I educated myself on the topic, held myself and others around me accountable for responsible consumption and disposal, and I got involved locally.
      </p>
       <p>
         The way that I see it, we have one planet and it is our responsibility to take care of it. I live a mile from the beach so as I have gotten older, the increasing pollution and decreasing water quality has shocked me. To aid in sparking change before the damage is irreversible, I took action
I joined Environmental Club at my school, became a Junior Beach Captain for Clean Ocean Action (local organization), and recently became apart of the Junior Green Team in my town. Joining Environmental Club and Clean Ocean Action has introduced me to many threats to our environment that I was unaware of. I realized that without even noticing, I had been a non point source for nearly my whole life.
However, recognizing my previous faults, I dedicated much time to being an activist for the environment. I heavily researched the town water pollution levels last year and was appalled at the amount of fecal matter in the water. This comes from non point source pollution, such as yard chemicals and not picking up after pets.
If we are educated about our accidental pollution, the condition of our planet will improve. Feel free to read my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15j7K7px4cDqjP3Gj6Y8DvfJNYNxQq0m8I4Vy1gAhttg/edit?usp=sharing"> speech</a>  that I performed for my English class last year.
