        An easy way to ensure you're being ecofriendly is by recycling the appropriate items!

          According to <a href="https://www.insider.com/things-that-dont-belong-in-recycling-2018-4" >Insider,</a> it is crucial in knowing what to recycle. It is always best to check if a material can be recycled because even some things made of recycled materials CANNOT be recycled. To make this process easier, here are some generalizations on recycling DO's and DO NOT's:
          <ul class="recyclables">
            DO NOT recycle... 
            <li>styrofoam (not biodegradable) </li>
            <li>bubble wrap (film tangles in recycling machines)</li>
            <li>dishes (can contaminate recycled glass)</li>
            <li>electronic cords (difficult to separate recyclable parts)</li>
            <li>aerosol cans (due to pressuredized air contained)</li>
            <li>plastic bags (not biodegradable & biggest source of marine debris)</li>
            <li>single use,rechargable, and car batteries</li>
            <li>mirrors</li>
            <li>hangers (typically not purely metal or plastic so not recyclable)</li>
            <li>paper towels (have other substance on them & already been recycled so fibers short)</li>
           <li> clothes</li>
        </ul>

        Another overlooked but significant way to avoid harming the environment is by always picking up your pets waste! 

      </p>
       <p>
         Rain picks up the fecal matter when not picked up which results in its presence in local bodies of water. On top of the gruesome factor of the contaminated water, it has very harmful health affects. According to the <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/Pubs/331-181.pdf?TSPD_101_R0=e8a6b47978ac1590fb3b38e1c4bf19aba7800000000000000003eff356cffff00000000000000000000000000005c75e6fd0051ad3c7908d53046a7ab2000f0e09a1b06f96401c26b6d7b6a6ddaec766ed868d645f76461f617d5b6f4086408612be64b0a280071e2de426e47e46999a50967180bca578faaa11e919673b1ee59d36dd6fb51e421ff217ad319f8e8"> Washington State Department of Health</a>, pet and human waste contains coliform bacteria. While coliform bacteria will not lead to sickness, the presence of feces produces pathogens which are organisms that can lead to illness if consumed. In other words, when one neglects to pick up after their pets, the waste ends up in the local watershed so if one were to be in the water and accidentally swallow some, they could get sick.
